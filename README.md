📈 Stock Price Prediction (Short-Term) — Machine Learning Project

This project predicts the next day's closing price of a selected stock using historical data fetched from Yahoo Finance.
The goal is to understand time series handling, data fetching using APIs, and regression-based prediction.

🎯 Project Objective

The main objective of this task is to:

✔ Fetch historical stock market data using the yfinance API
✔ Explore and understand stock price features
✔ Train a machine learning model (Linear Regression or Random Forest)
✔ Predict the next day’s closing price
✔ Compare actual vs predicted prices using plots

📂 Dataset Source

The dataset is fetched automatically using the yfinance Python library.
You can choose any stock such as:

AAPL – Apple

TSLA – Tesla

MSFT – Microsoft
